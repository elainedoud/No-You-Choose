Our project, “No You Choose”, allows users to easily find a brewery in their city.  Users can enter the name of a U.S. city and click “submit”.  A random brewery in their city will then be displayed on the screen, including a hyper-link to the brewery’s website.  The API Open Brewery Database was our source for brewery information.  The “Give Me Another One” button will display additional breweries if clicked.  Our project has two separate color options, which can be viewed by clicking the “Switch Color Mode” button.
