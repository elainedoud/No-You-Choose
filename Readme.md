Our project, “No You Choose”, allows users to easily find a brewery in their city.  Users can enter the name of a U.S. city and click “submit”.  A random brewery in their city will then be displayed on the screen.  The API Open Brewery Database was our source for brewery information.  The “Give Me Another One” button will display additional breweries if clicked.  Our project also has a like button, which turns gold when clicked.

This project uses JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and a mp4 video for its background.
